The Code Manifesto
==================

We want to work in an ecosystem that empowers developers to reach their potential--one that encourages growth and effective collaboration. A space that is safe for all.

A space such as this benefits everyone that participates in good faith. It encourages new developers to enter our field. It is through discussion and collaboration that we grow, and through growth that we improve.

In the effort to create such a place, we hold to these values:
1. *Discrimination harms us*. This includes discrimination, derogatory language, or harassment on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, nationality, technology and any other arbitrary designation of a group of people.
2. *Boundaries honor us*. Your comfort levels are not everyoneâ€™s comfort levels. Remember that, and if brought to your attention, heed it.
3. *We are our biggest assets*. None of us were born masters of our trade. Each of us has been helped along the way. Return that favor when you can, and be respectful of others' place in their journey.
4. *Respect defines us*. Treat others with respect and compassion unless they abuse that trust. Make your discussions, criticisms and debates from a position of respect for the humanity of all involved. Ask yourself, is it true? Is it necessary? Is it constructive? Anything less is missing the mark.
5. *Reactions require grace*. Angry responses are valid, but neither abusive language nor harmful actions are acceptable. If something happens which concerns you, address it directly or report it, but be respectful. Allow the organizers time to discuss the incident with the offender and possibly correct the issue.
6. *To err is human; always be iterating*. You might not intend it, but mistakes do happen and contribute to build experience. Tolerate honest mistakes, and don't hesitate to apologize if you make one yourself. Remember, apologies are hallow without also correcting the behavior.
