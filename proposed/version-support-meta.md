PSR-Version Support Meta Document
=================================

1. Summary
----------

PHP has a long history of slow adoption of new versions of the language. A major
factor in that slow adoption curve is the reluctance of public web hosts to upgrade
their offerings without pressure from their customers, while major PHP projects
are reluctant to adopt new PHP versions while few public hosts support it. Few
projects wish to be the first to drop old versions for fear of alienating their
user base. This chicken-and-egg problem is one of the reasons why many PHP projects
lag far behind PHP itself in terms of the languages features they adopt.

3. Scope
--------

## 3.1 Goals

This standard serves as a "community covenant" for projects and hosts to agree on
an approximate schedule for when they will adopt and drop support for PHP versions.
By synchronizing release schedules, no project is overly penalized for being first
to drop support for a given PHP version and public hosts have a clear timeline
they can factor into their normal upgrade schedules.

## 3.2 Non-Goals

This document does not seek to impose any architectural decisions on participating
projects, nor to dictate what language features they use.
